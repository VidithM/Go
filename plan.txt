- Divided into 3 major components
    - Scraping
        - Start at some initial point, scrape, and discover new links to visit
        - Perform scraping in a breadth-first fashion
            - Maintain a queue of links to visit 
                - Limit depth to 100

    - Indexing
        - Stores "site manifests", which are the results of scraping 
        - Site URL, page title, subtitles, headers, etc.
    
    - Querying/Ranking
        -  Can use a rudimentary ranking system
            - Go through each index, count #of matching keywords as rank 
        - For now, rank every index entry and include the top 10 in results
